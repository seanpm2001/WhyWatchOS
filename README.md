# whyWatchOS

whyWatchOS is an open source recreation of watchOS. It is part of the WacOS operating system project. 

## Language

The system is currently written in C, but will also support several other languages, including x86 Assembly, Objective-C, and Swift.

### Programming language support

Objective-C is bumped up to version 2.0 (As of whyWatchOS 1)

Swift is bumped to version 3.0 (As of whyWatchOS 1)

Python is not included

Ruby is not included

## Feature translation notes

The exact system requirements are not a forced emulation option. The whyWatchOS system is designed to be lighter, but you can adjust it to match watchOS.

WacOS equivalents of programs are included.

Malicious methods (such as DRM/TPM) are NEVER included with WacOS, not even as an open source recreation.

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/) if any other clarification is needed.
